// each image in the database needs a new attribute: scramble state
// when you create the image, scramble it once, record the positions of the 
// tiles in an array, and save that
// next time you look at the puzzle (or any user does), and hits the scramble 
// button, it will scramble to that predefined state

// how would we do this with ruby?

// in the images controller, the create function would call another function in the model
